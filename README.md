## 🛠️ How It Works
- **Content Script (`content.js`)**  
  Runs in the context of each webpage. It scans page elements (URLs, forms, text) for suspicious patterns and reports back.

- **Background Script (`background.js`)**  
  Acts as the extension’s brain. It receives signals from content scripts, runs detection logic, and triggers alerts/notifications.

- **Popup (`popup.html`)**  
  Provides a simple interface for viewing detection results and interacting with the extension.

- **Options Page**  
  Let's users configure settings such as sensitivity, whitelist/blacklist, and detection preferences.
